These files are used for providing the code to answer questions of assignment 3 in SLE712 Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at Deakin University.
### Personal information
- Student's name: Thi Linh Chi Tran
- Student ID: 220030174
### Part 1 
 This folder contains `part1.Rmd` and `part1.pdf`. The `part1.Rmd` includes code to solve questions related to importing files, mathematical operations, creating plots and working with Github on the provided data of gene expression and tree growth. ```part1.pdf```is the file of output report for part 1.
- Inputs: data from two files `gene_expression.tsv` and `growth_data.csv`.
- Outputs: find highest expression genes, the number of gene with a mean <10, plot (histogram, boxplot); mean growth, mean, sd, p-value related to tree growth. 

##### How to run:
- Step 1: Login to Rstudio Account
- Step 2: Clone code from GitHub using `git clone https://github.com/LinhChi1323/SLE712_Assignment_3`
- Step 3: Open file `part1.Rmd` in `part1` folder and run this code on Rstudio


### Part 2 
This folder contains `part2.Rmd` and `part2.pdf`. The `part2.Rmd` includes the code to solve questions related to apply supplied functions to analysis the limits of BLAST for allocated sequecence (13-th sequence). ```part2.pdf```is the file of output report for part 2.
- Input: the whole E.coli gene sequence, my interest sequence (13th sequence).
- Output: length and GC proportion of allocated sequence, blast search results, pairwise alignment, the limits of blast.
